### Hi, I’m Yaman 👋

Security Engineer & SOC Analyst with a strong foundation in **incident detection, network security, and applied security research**.  
I enjoy working close to real systems — monitoring, investigating, and improving security signals — and I’m especially interested in **detection engineering, security operations, and research-driven security engineering**.
